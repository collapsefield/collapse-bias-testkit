# Collapse Bias Test Kit

**A public-facing test environment for exploring collapse bias in symbolic systems.**

This project offers a minimal, open test kit for examining whether symbolic inputs can bias collapse outcomes in digital systems. It provides a simple framework for running structured JSON-based experiments and observing output behavior in response to weighted cue structures.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

The test kit is designed to:

- Demonstrate symbolic input effects on output selection
- Let users experiment with input prompts that may influence response direction
- Serve as a base for future exploration of observer-influenced emergence

**Note:** This is not a claim of sentience, AGI, or metaphysics. It is a sandboxed logic testbed built for structured experimentation.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

This kit includes:

- Sample JSON test structures
- Streamlit interface for visual testing (coming soon)
- Public documentation and guidance for exploratory users

All cue weighting logic, symbolic schemas, and deep mechanics are **intentionally withheld** to preserve system integrity and prevent misuse. Only the **visible shell** is public.
