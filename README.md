# collapse-bias-testkit
A public-facing test kit for exploring collapse bias in symbolic systems. Run your own experiments using structured JSON inputs to observe potential pattern-weighted collapse behavior. Built for transparency, testing, and collaborative explorationâ€”core algorithms and bias layers remain protected.
