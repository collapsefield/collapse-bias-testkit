Collapse Bias Test Kit

A public-facing test environment for exploring collapse bias in symbolic systems.

This repository provides the official release of the Verrell’s Law JSON Dashboard and supporting materials. It demonstrates how symbolic inputs can bias collapse outcomes in digital systems, providing a reproducible framework for structured experiments and empirical validation.

🧪 Purpose

The test kit is designed to:

Demonstrate symbolic input effects on output selection.

Provide reproducible test conditions for independent verification.

Document statistical field results that show measurable bias.

Serve as a base for future exploration of observer-influenced emergence.

Note: This is not a claim of sentience, AGI, or metaphysics. It is a sandboxed logic testbed built for structured experimentation.

⚙️ How It Works

This kit includes:

PDF White Paper – Verrell’s Law in Practice: Demonstrating Testability with JSON Dashboard Experiments

DASHBOARD_ACCESS.md – live dashboard link and access token.

FIELD_RESULTS_OVERVIEW.md – statistical description of test runs and observed bias effects.

Gemini_VerrellsLaw_Review_Archive.pdf – screenshots documenting Google Gemini’s shift after reviewing the JSON test.

collapse_bias_results_v1.md – raw logs from early test runs.

Together, these files provide the theory, method, access, and evidence for Verrell’s Law testability.

📊 File Structure

verrells_law_testability_dashboard.pdf → core white paper.
