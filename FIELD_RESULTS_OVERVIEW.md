# Verrell’s Law – Field Results Overview

This file summarizes the statistical outputs and observed behavior from the JSON Dashboard test series.  
All runs were symbolic-only (no sentience or metaphysical claims).

## ⚗️ Test Series

### 🧪 Test 01 – Unbiased Input
- **Run ID:** Test_01_Unbiased  
- **Input Bias:** None (uniform input distribution)  
- **Observation:** Slight lean toward 🌊 (Wave). No strong bias detected.  

### 🧪 Test 02 – Biased Memory Heavy
- **Run ID:** Test_02_Biased_MemoryHeavy  
- **Input Bias:** Memory-heavy symbolic weighting  
- **Observation:** Strong skew toward 🌊 (Wave). Non-random collapse, memory echo reinforcing repeated dominance.  

### 🧪 Test 03 – Balanced Input
- **Run ID:** Test_03_Balanced  
- **Input Bias:** Equal weighting  
- **Observation:** Two identical outputs followed by symbolic shift, suggesting bias neutralization or latent field rebalancing.
