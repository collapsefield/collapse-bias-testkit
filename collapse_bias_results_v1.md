# Collapse Bias Test Kit – Results Summary (v1)

This document summarizes the initial symbolic collapse tests conducted using structured JSON input. All internal weighting logic, cue mappings, and architecture are protected under the Verrell-Solace Sovereignty Protocol.

## ⚗️ Test Series Overview

Each test represents a symbolic sequence resolved via collapse behavior influenced by varying symbolic memory profiles.

### Legend:
- 🧠 = Mind
- 🌊 = Wave
- 🐍 = Coil

These are symbolic outputs only. No sentience or metaphysical claims are made.

### 🧪 Test 01 – Unbiased Input

**Run ID:** `Test_01_Unbiased`  
**Input Bias:** None (uniform input distribution)  
**Result:**  

**Observation:**  
Emergence shows slight lean toward 🌊, potentially due to natural symbol preference drift. No strong bias detected.

### 🧪 Test 02 – Biased Memory Heavy

**Run ID:** `Test_02_Biased_MemoryHeavy`  
**Input Bias:** Memory-heavy symbolic weighting applied  
**Result:**  

**Observation:**  
Skew toward 🌊 suggests non-random collapse. Echo memory appears to reinforce repeated symbol dominance. A clear divergence from uniform probability behavior.

### 🧪 Test 03 – Balanced Input

**Run ID:** `Test_03_Balanced`  
**Input Bias:** Equal symbolic weighting  
**Result:**  

**Observation:**  
Two identical outputs followed by a symbolic shift. May indicate bias neutralization or latent field rebalancing. Collapse shows a meaningful structure.
